# Hangman-Game
In this application I built a basic hangman game. The app runs in the browser and is powered by JavaScript.

## Instructions
The user will be displayed a game field, where they will guess letters to try to fill the empty spaces of the current word to be guessed. As the user guesses correct letters the will populate the underscores where they belong. If the user guess an incorrect letter it will populate the letters guessed area, and the "guesses left" counter will decrease by 1. Once the user guesses the full word or runs out of guesses, will determine whether the user wins or losses. The game score will be kept until the page is refresehed.
